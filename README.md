# momsbirds

This experimental website shows my mother's birding life list. You can navigate around the data by year or by text-based search, which matches name or location information. A live version of this is available at http://explore.infogoer.com/momsbirds. I reserve the right to take the site down since the Mapbox service it depends on is metered and usage may exceed the free level.

This repo is not intended to be usable by the general public. It is made public here as a demonstration of one of my personal programming efforts to keep my technical skills up and to satisfy my interests in software development.

The ultimate aim for this is to experiement with creating, training and implementing language models that can assist in entering the bird sighting information by voice commands. A preliminary private version of this uses https://wit.ai and other Mapbox APIs in this effort. If you look into the src/services/wit folder you can preliminary work in this area. When that functionality is fully implemented I'll add it to the live site.
